In this folder, I identified insertions corresponding to two insertions (ngln2a and trps1) previously identified in GWAS performed by B. Fischer and followed up their distribution across populations. The third insertion, in ntrk3a, was not identified (likely because also associated with an inversion - more complex structure in this region).
