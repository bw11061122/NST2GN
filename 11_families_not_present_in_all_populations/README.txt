In this folder, I analyse the distribution of families not present in all populations (I identified 16 families for which there was no good evidence that they were identified in at least one population; note this does not mean the family is absent in this specific population but that it was just not detected). 
In the results section, I included the histogram and a general table showing the distribution of insertions derived from these 16 identified families across populations.
